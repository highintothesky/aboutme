# Hi!

My name is Niels, and I program from time to time, mostly in Python.

I use this space to showcase some of the projects I've done, some professionally, and some as a hobby.


**KomKom Admin**

I wrote this piece of administration software freelance, for a friend who brews [Kombutcha](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kombucha) and needed some help organizing his ingredient purchases, batch production, sales, taxes etc. Some graphs and a pdf export function are also included. All data you see here is dummy data.
